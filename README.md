# Jamaican Anolis


A collection of R scripts used for analyzing a rad-seq dataset of the _Placopsis_ radiation of anoles.

This includes a short script for simulating mtDNA genes-trees in order to test whether the non-monophyly of A. opalinus in the mtDNA gene-tree could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting or for example, introgression with mitochondrial genome capture.


The manuscript for this work is currently in review:

Deep-Time Reticulation and Ancient Mitochondrial Genome Capture During the Radiation of Jamaican Anolis Lizards (Squamata; Iguanidae)
