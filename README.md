# Jamaican Anolis


A collection of R scripts used for analyzing a rad-seq dataset of all _Placopsis_ radiation of anoles.

This includes a short script for simulating mtDNA genes-trees in order to test whether the non-monophyly of A. opalinus in the mtDNA gene-tree could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting or for example, introgression with mitochondrial genome capture.
